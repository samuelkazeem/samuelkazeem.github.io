		<p class="blog-post-meta border-bottom">June 12, 2025</p>

		<p>Time existed before you were born. Will be long after you are dead.</p>

		<p>Your life means nothing to time.</p>

		<p>Time has nothing to do with life. It goes along without ever a pause. Never taking your life into account.</p>

		<p>The moment you were born the seasons of your life begin. Seasons are tied to the individual.</p>

		<p>Life is measured in seasons and seasons happen in time.</p>

		<p>If by time, then all born at similar times should be synchronized, but not so, two are born the same day, the season of planting for the one happens at time t, while that of the other happens at time t + X or t â€“ X, same follows the season of reaping.</p>

		<p>Two friends leaving school together might end up dying rich, but the odds they will get rich at the same time is low. Their seasons in time differs.</p>

		<p>Hence, those who compare themselves to others are not wise.</p>

		<p>Life is in seasons.</p>

		<p>David was anointed king a teenager, by reason of time, the anointed king should be on the throne. Not by reason of seasons.</p>

		<p>Seasons play out in time and time takes time.</p>

		<p>Joseph dreamed of being bowed to by his family. The same threw him in a well. But seasons are not a function of time. In due season, they not only bowed, they trembled at his presence.</p>

		<p>After it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women, she conceived and bare Isaac.</p>

		<p>By reason of time, menopause had come, but by reason of season, the time to birth the seed had come, hence the negation of time for the accomplishment of the season.</p>

		<p>Seasons therefore are not a function of time, they happen in time.</p>

		<p>An understanding of one's seasons is crucial.</p>

		<p>What season are you in now?</p>

		<p>Someone knows. God knows.</p>

		<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
