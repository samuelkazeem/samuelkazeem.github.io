		<p>It is not the best writer that sells the most books.</p>
		<p>It is not the best singer that sells the most albums.</p>
		<p>It is not the tallest who becomes the basketball MVP.</p>
		<p>It is not the strongest who becomes the heavyweight champion.</p>
		<p>It is not the most beautiful who has a beautiful life.</p>
		<p>It is not the most intelligent who becomes the happiest.</p>
		<p>It is not the larger army that wins the war.</p>
		<p>It is not the hardest worker who becomes the richest.</p>
		<p>It is not the best idea that turns into the best product.</p>
		<p>It is not the company that raises more money that wins the market.</p>
		<p>It is not the â€¦</p>
		<p>The one is not the other, the other is not the one.</p>
		<p>For time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
		<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
