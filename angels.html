		<p class="blog-post-meta border-bottom">August 3, 2025</p>

		<h5>1.</h5>
		<p><em>“And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. Man did eat angel’s food”</em> – Psalm 78:24–25</p>
		<p>And again:</p>
		<p><em>“And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat... and he did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.”</em> – 1 Kings 19:5–8</p>
		<p>Angels are not eternally strong, for they have their own food—hence they are also subject to weakness. First manna, then cake. They must also have delicacies like pepper soup.</p>

		<h5>2.</h5>
		<p><em>“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?”</em> – Hebrews 1:14</p>
		<p>Angels run errands from God, for the sake of mankind.</p>

		<h5>3.</h5>
		<p><em>“Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand... the prince of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me.”</em> – Daniel 10:12–13</p>
		<p>There is hierarchy in the spiritual realm. Being for God or not is irrelevant. The initial angel, though delivering an errand from God, could not overcome the prince of Persia until Michael, one of the most senior angels, came to help. <br>
		Signifying that though he was for God, the prince of Persia was higher in hierarchy than he was, hence could successfully withstand him, but not Michael. </p>

		<h5>4.</h5>
		<p><em>“And has made us sit together with him at the right hand of God, far above all principalities and powers and rulers of the darkness of this world.”</em> – Ephesians</p>
		<p>The believer, by virtue of being in Christ, has been elevated beyond all hierarchy in the spiritual realm, angels inclusive.</p>

		<h5>5.</h5>
		<p><em>“And the angel of the Lord went further and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand…”</em> – Numbers 22:26–27, 31</p>
		<p>And again:</p>
		<p><em>“And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, it is the voice of god, and not of a man. And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.”</em> – Acts 12:21–23</p>
		<p>And again:</p>
		<p><em>“And Zacharias said unto the angel, whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed…”</em> – Luke 1:18–20</p>
		<p>Angels have personalities and some, seeming with higher hierarchy, have the right to inflict punishment or kill humans of their own accord.
		The angel that dealt with Balaam was patient, gave him several opportunities, to the point of his seeing into the spiritual realm, but was also ready to kill him had he gone further. That which dealt with Herod, not so much as a blink, same with that which dealt with Zacharias, did not bother with explanation, immediate punishment.
		</p>

		<h5>6.</h5>
		<p><em>“And the angels which kept not their first estate... he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgement of the great day.”</em> – Jude 1:5</p>
		<p>And again:</p>
		<p><em>“And there was war in heaven... and the dragon was cast out, that old serpent... and his angels were cast out with him.”</em> – Revelation 12:7–9</p>
		<p>Angels have will. They can obey, offend, or disobey God. Catch-22? They do not have their own Christ. There is no redemption plan for them. One shot at rebellion is all they have—Jesus did not take on the form of angels.</p>

		<h5>7.</h5>
		<p><em>“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</em> – Luke 2:13–14</p>
		<p>They rejoice at the wonders of the Almighty.</p>
