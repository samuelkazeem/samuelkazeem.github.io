		<p class="blog-post-meta border-bottom">July 19, 2025</p>

		<p>There are three types of professions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Professions where <strong>productivity</strong> is the essential core (Scientists, Engineers, Entrepreneurs, Teachers, Pharmacists, Nurses, Janitors, Dry Cleaners, …)</li>
			<li>Professions where <strong>pretending to be productive</strong> is the essential core (Politicians, Civil Servants, Police officers, Doctors, Consultants, Weather forecasters, Economists, …)</li>
			<li>Criminal lawyers and casket makers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Type 1</h4>
		<p>In the world of type 1 professions, the pride of the participants is tied to the results they get, and these results can be verified by others—it is in no way subjective to the person who did the work.</p>

		<p>The people in these professions work for the good of those who will use their work; those who do not are quickly shredded from the system. You have to be productive—it literally cannot be any other way.</p>

		<p>Awards in these types of professions are usually prestigious for the simple fact that the reasons the award was given to person A and not B are always easily verified by everyone.</p>

		<br>
		<h4>Type 2</h4>
		<p>In the world of type 2 professions, if you try to be too productive you get into trouble. The ultimate mantra is to keep the system going—everyone must eat—hence the illusion of productivity.</p>

		<p>If the police actually do productive work, crime would plummet instantly, putting the next generation of police officers probably out of work. Even the current ones will have a hard time manufacturing reasons to be celebrated and promoted. The mere existence of the police necessitates that they do not eradicate crime; rather, if necessary, promote it.</p>

		<p>If politicians would stop stealing the people’s money or constantly flexing their egos by spending insane amounts on war, but rather actually govern productively for the people, what would happen? Poverty as we know it—lack of food, shelter and infrastructure—would literally disappear. What cause would the politician campaign on in the next round of elections? Nothing. Who would attend their rallies? Nobody. All their “customers” are no longer interested in listening to “I will provide one billion jobs in my first six months in office.” Game over.</p>

		<p>Economists and weather forecasters are barely ever right, but they never stop predicting—you get the drill.</p>

		<p>The ultimate test if you are in a type one or two profession is this: Can another participant in your field, without your help, check you work and acertain it? If yes, type one, else, type two.</p>

		<br>
		<h4>Then You Have Type 3</h4>
		<p>Some work, others pretend to work, but these guys, God have mercy.</p>

		<p>If business is slow, what do they wish or pray for?</p>

		<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
