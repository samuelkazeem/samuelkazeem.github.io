		<p>"For the life of the flesh is in the blood" – Leviticus 17:11</p>

		<p>The key at the ignition turned to start, of an automobile, triggers a process that if sustained keeps the engine running which in turn gives the automobile life.</p>

		<p>So also is the blood, so long as it is being pumped through the body, passes nutrients along that in turn gives the body life.</p>

		<p>"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption incorruption. For this corruptible must put on incorruptible, and this mortal must put on immortality." – 1 Corinthians 15: 50, 53</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another." - 1 Corinthians 15: 39, 40</p>
		
		<p>From the writings of Paul there are evidently two classes of flesh or bodies, one that is mortal or can die, one that is immortal. The mortal is sustained by blood circulating nutrients to it continuously, the immortal is forever, having no need of sustenance - no blood.</p>

		<p>Here is Jesus after he arose from the dead: <br>
		"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have." - Luke 24:39 </p>

		<p>
			Jesus no longer had blood as his means of fleshly sustenance – for a spirit hath not <strong>flesh and bones</strong>. Which also implies he had put an immortal body.
		</p>

		<p>
			Where was his blood?
		</p>

		<p>
			"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." - Hebrews 9:12
		</p>

		<p>
			The only blood that circulated in a mortal body that did not sin neither lift itself up against the Almighty was taken into the holies of holies of the Almighty for an eternal atonement for them that believe in he who made the sacrifice.
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			"For we are members of <strong>his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."</strong> – Ephesians 5:30
		</p>

		<p>
			So that even in his resurrected state, he did not transform into pure spirit, rather he maintained the form of man, howbeit with an immortal body.<br>
			So that on earth and in heaven he continues to identify with us.
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." - Hebrews 7:25
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." - Hebrew 4:16
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us." - Romans 8:23
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			"He is not here: for he is risen" - Matthew 28:6
		</p>

		<p>And again</p>

		<p>
			Thank you for reading.<br>
			Happy Easter.
