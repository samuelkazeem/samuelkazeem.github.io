		<p class="blog-post-meta border-bottom">April 04, 2025</p>

		<p>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>

		<p>And again: Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
		</p>

		<p>The present is a manifestation of the acts of persons who moved by faith in the past.</p>

		<p>The future will be a manifestation of people who by reason of faith act now to bring about the vison they see.</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity.
		</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity, for without it only that which is seen is real and by it even that which is not apparent is as real as that which is - <strong>the substance</strong> of things not seen.</p>

		<p>When a man moves by faith those with little minds who live by sight make jest, they live only in the now, he lives in the now and is also aware he will have to live in the future, knowing then that the future will be different from the now he acts differently.</p>

		<p>By faith Noah prepared an ark on dry land, believing that the flood which God has shown him will certainly come to pass. How ridiculous, yet it paid off.</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity.</p>

		<p>The man who does not move by faith waits for the apparent, he sees the flood and then seeks his own ark – too late.</p>

		<p>By reason of faith though we be in the present we do not live in the present, we forge towards the future which we believe will be.
		</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity.</p>

		<p>By faith we become gods – those who create the seen from the unseen – godlike: Let there be light, in the face of darkness.</p>

		<p>By faith Jesus, believing in him who cannot lie, offered up himself to die on the cross, through which he became the savior of the world. How impossible! The savior of the world hanged by those he is to save? Yet he arose.</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity, for by it we learn to walk not only by sight.</p>

		<p>For without faith it is impossible to build the future, for how can a man dedicate himself, despise difficult circumstances, overcome obstacles, strive against people who out of a wicked heart seek to destroy him, continue against those who out of envy seek to take him down, for the man who will build the future, faith is a necessity.</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity, for though we be in the present we can live in the future by the substantiveness of faith, and when those who live by sight come around to that future they will be living in a world those who live by faith have created and now own.</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity, for without it, it is impossible to please God. Now who wouldn’t want to please God?</p>

		<p>Faith is a necessity.</p>
