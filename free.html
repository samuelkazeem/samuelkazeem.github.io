		Free things and the human psychological make up have a contradictory relationship.<br>

		The important and fundamental things in life are free, yet the way human psychology works is such that it places inordinate value on things that costs us much more than things that are essential to life and are free.<br>

		We hardly know the importance of peace till conflict is the order of the day.<br>

		We hardly value trust until we lose the trust others placed freely in us. Have you ever tried regaining trust? It's mission impossible.<br>

		We hardly value hope till we come to a place of despair.<br>

		Free things might not cost us a dime, but when we lose or are on the brink of losing them, we come to realize that the things that cost us a dime are only relevant because we have the free things that do not cost us a dime.

		<h3><strong>What then?</strong></h3>
		Free things are free for a reason - they truly cannot be priced, meaning they are <a href="/eternity-infinity/">infinitely</a> more expensive than the things we can price and purchase, hence are more valuable than things that are priced and we get a sense of their priceless nature when weÂ  lose or almost lose them. Value the priceless for few recover them when lost.<br><br>
