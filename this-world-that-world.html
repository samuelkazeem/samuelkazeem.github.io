		<p>“But Abraham said, son remember”</p>

		<p>“There was a certain rich man,… And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus,… And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me,… But Abraham said, Son, remember…” - Luke 16:19-24</p>

		<p>When the gospels say “certain,” it means it was not a parable, but rather a particular or actual event that happened—either in this world (where mortality prevails) or in that world (where immortality prevails).</p>

		<p>So that Jesus speaks of a happenstance between two men in this world (one rich, the other poor), and their transition into that world, wherein the one was suffering and the other was comforted.</p>

		<p>Pay close attention to the fact that Jesus was the one speaking, meaning the events happened before the death or resurrection of the Christ, yet the wicked are actually still punished for their acts after they die – a subject for another day.</p>

		<p><strong>Son, remember.</strong></p>

		<p>By saying “Son, remember” to the rich man, Abraham reveals something important to us about transitioning from this world to that world – our memory remains intact.</p>

		<p>To seal this, the rich man would plead for a special messenger to be sent to his family members, that they may not also end up in the same place as he. Though no longer in this world (earth), he remembers his family members on earth, and also, he recognized Lazarus in that world.</p>

		<p>Pretty interesting isn’t it?</p>

		<p>This world and that world, which we will all go to after we die, are irrevocably interconnected.</p>

		<p>“For we shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ” – Romans 14:10</p>

		<p>To give account of the things we did in our bodies, and if we cannot remember what we did or who we did them to or with, how shall we give account? Certainly, we will remember them all.</p>

		<p>Now what shall we say to these things?</p>

		<p>Though we leave this world through death, each of us as an individual still exists with his or her memories intact, the difference is that we will no longer be subject to death.</p>

		<p>I do not understand Karma, I understand judgement.</p>

		<p>“Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.” – Proverbs 11:21</p>

		<p>Our actions in this world have consequences, most importantly, in that world – for it is eternal, hence with all that is within you do good to your fellow brother.</p>

		<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
