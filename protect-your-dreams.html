		<h3><strong>Fragile</strong></h3>
			Fragile objects do not like turbulence.<br><br>
			Fragile things must be guarded and protected, else they get destroyed.<br><br>
			Dreams are born in the delicate parts of the heart, of burning desire and <a href="http://samuelkazeem.com/ambition">ambition.</a><br><br>
			Vision is the biological child of a dream.<br><br>
			Till a dream has physical validation in the world and gradually become reality, it is fragile and fragile things must be protected.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3><strong>Faith</strong></h3>
		The man with a dream must be a man of faith, faith is a necessity for a man to set out in pursuit of that which he cannot see, hear or touch, faith is a must for dreamers, for faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, for by it the elders obtained a good report.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3><strong>Enemy</strong></h3>
		The first enemy of dreams is doubt in the heart of the dreamer. This must be overcome before one can set out, but at least one has only him or herself to deal with.<br><br>

		The greatest enemy of dreamers are those without dreams, are those without faith, are those who never perceive anything other than what their senses show them. Of such are those of whom it is written: And they perished because of unbelief. Of such are those who seeing you move and not understanding what moves you, plot against you, seeking to drag you down for no other reason than they envy that you have something you are pursuing, there really are people like that, who are willing to embarrass themselves just to take you down, who are willing to swirl in the mud like pigs just to destroy that thing they see in your eyes that they do not have.<br><br>

		Of such are they which spoke to Moses, who made you a leader over us? Not out of having a better idea of leading the Israelites nor of having interest in bearing the burden of leadership, but out of sheer envy that he is leading.<br><br>

		Dreams must be protected.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3><strong>Signs</strong></h3>
		Watch out for snide remarks and terrible looks that are uttered or made without provocation. These are never by mistake, they come from deep down in these wicked souls who have stewed in private over and over about how to destroy you and are gradually unable to hold it back physically. Of such, absolutely stay away from by all means.
		<br><br>

		The dreamer must choose carefully who to associate with and what environment to pursue his or her dreams in, this is essential as an environment filled with people without dreams inevitably will drown you, you are fighting uphill â€“ too much energy to expend.<br><br>
		Dreams must be protected.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
		Those without dreams could be friends, family members, neighbors, fellow workers. They are usually close by, the one who cannot see you pursuing your dreams can hardly hinder you.<br><br>
		Pursuing your dream is a difficult enough enterprise, best to avoid stupid battles, move away and expend your energy trying to actualize your dreams.<br><br>
		Compliments of the season.<br><br>
		Thank you for reading.
