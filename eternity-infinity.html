		Eternity is a word that signifies a nature that is not subject to change, a universe that remains and stays, never fluctuates between states, a universe in which time is irrelevant because change does not exist in it.<br>

		Infinity signifies a ‘certain’ point in a physical property which we cannot measure, though we know it exists, we cannot keep count, no number or value can be placed on that property at that point, a point in which precise measurement is impossible.

		<h3>POTENTIALLY INFINITE</h3>
		After how many aromas does the nose refuse to smell anymore?<br>

		After how many objects does the eye refuse to see anymore?<br>



		After how many touches does the skin refuse to feel anymore?<br>

		After how many items does the tongue refuse to taste anymore?<br>

		After how many thoughts does the brain refuse to know anymore?<br>

		After how many words does the mouth refuse to speak anymore?<br>

		After how many steps does the feet refuse to move anymore?<br>

		After how many …<br>

		There is no reasonable number, no measurement or limit one can place on our predominant physical features, they act as though they could go on forever doing what they were designed to do, they function as though there is no inherent numerical limit placed on their ability to function, as though they were not built to even be measured, hence we live in a potentially infinite reality.
		</p>

		<h3>POSSIBLE ETERNITY</h3>
		Except something has really gone wrong, no one wants to die, everyone wants to live.<br>

		We get ill, we curse the illness and seek a solution that we may be well and continue living.<br>

		Where do we get this desire from?<br>

		Why do we have this desire?<br>

		Why is this desire universal?<br>

		The desire to live is rooted in us, fundamentally.<br>

		However we see that because people change, because we die, we are not eternal.<br>

		Yet, consider that some pay as much as $200,000 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics">cryonics</a>, keeping their whole body or specific parts (mostly the brain) preserved till a breakthrough is hopefully had in getting humans to live forever, thus bringing them back to life. That is how far some of us go in expressing this innate desire.<br>

		Maybe there is hope in such research, I will not bank on it.<br>

		For it does seem, like it or not, that the current state of the universe is designed to suck life out of us, bit by bit, little by little, the universe puts pressure on us to perform, to give of ourselves, to serve, to labor, and as we do, we use up ourselves, our energies, our lives, so that sooner rather than latter we die of ‘natural causes’, and those who do not like ‘natural causes’, soon enough ‘unnatural causes’ will visit, point is, inevitably, the universe sucks you into herself, just as she sustained you through your living days.<br>

		So that those who want to make us live forever in this current state, will not only look into how to sustain our biology over time, but also discover how to prevent nature from ‘killing’ her inhabitants, through natural or unnatural events which are mostly unforeseen.<br>

		If you think that is possible, kudos to your imagination, I have not been blessed with such beautiful imagination, hence we cannot have eternity in this current state.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>IN CONCLUSION</h3>
		We currently live in a world of infinite properties and possibilities, but not an eternal one, yet we desire an eternal life, we desire to live forever.<br>

		Why do we have this desire, despite evidence in the physical world to the contrary?<br>

		Could it be that there is truly life after death?<br>

		Could it be that we have a part of us that is seeking freedom from our bodies into its own eternal state, hence, our desire for eternity though still in the flesh?<br>

		Could it be that of a truth, we can live forever?<br>

		If it is true, what part of us gets transformed seeing that our bodies decay after death?<br>

		How does that part make the transformation?<br>

		What state do we transform into?<br>

		Will we still be identifiable in that state, that is, a pointer that it is person x who was on earth, that is also person x in an eternal state?
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>WHAT THEN?</h3>
		I am convinced that just as we have an inherent desire for food, signaled by hunger, an inherent desire for love, signaled by seeking connection with others and they get satisfied, in the same vein, our inherent desire for life, for eternity, signaled by our distaste for death, will also be satisfied.<br>

		This means that ‘one day’ we will live forever, in an eternal state, where time and change will be no more.<br>

		How? When? Where?<br>

		I do not know.
